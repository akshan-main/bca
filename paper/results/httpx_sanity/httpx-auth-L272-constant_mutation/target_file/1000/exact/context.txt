    Base class for all authentication schemes.

    To implement a custom authentication scheme, subclass `Auth` and override
    the `.auth_flow()` method.

    If the authentication scheme does I/O such as disk access or network calls, or uses
    synchronization primitives such as locks, you should override `.sync_auth_flow()`
    and/or `.async_auth_flow()` instead of `.auth_flow()` to provide specialized
    implementations that will be used by `Client` and `AsyncClient` respectively.

        A `return` (or reaching the end of the generator) will result in the
