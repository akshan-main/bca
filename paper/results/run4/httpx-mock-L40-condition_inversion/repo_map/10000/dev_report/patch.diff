        Send a single HTTP request asynchronously and return a response.

        Developers shouldn't typically ever need to call into this API directly,
        since the Client class provides all the higher level user-facing API
        niceties.

        Takes a `Request` instance as the only argument.

        Returns a `Response` instance.
