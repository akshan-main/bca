# pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/_parts_manager.py
"""This module provides functionality to manage and update parts of a model's streamed response.

The manager tracks which parts (in particular, text and tool calls) correspond to which
vendor-specific identifiers (e.g., `index`, `tool_call_id`, etc., as appropriate for a given model),
and produces Pydantic AI-format events as appropriate for consumers of the streaming APIs.

The "vendor-specific identifiers" to use depend on the semantics of the responses of the responses from the vendor,
and are tightly coupled to the specific model being used, and the Pydantic AI Model subclass implementation.

This `ModelResponsePartsManager` is used in each of the subclasses of `StreamedResponse` as a way to consolidate
event-emitting logic.
