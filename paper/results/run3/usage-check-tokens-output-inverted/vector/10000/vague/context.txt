            output validators since output validators would expect an argument that matches the agent's output type.
        message_history: History of the conversation so far.
        deferred_tool_results: Optional results for deferred tool calls in the message history.
        model: Optional model to use for this run, required if `model` was not set when creating the agent.
        deps: Optional dependencies to use for this run.
        model_settings: Optional settings to use for this model's request.
        usage_limits: Optional limits on model request count or token usage.
        usage: Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools.
        metadata: Optional metadata to attach to this run. Accepts a dictionary or a callable taking
            [`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext]; merged with the agent's configured metadata.
        infer_name: Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set.
        toolsets: Optional additional toolsets for this run.
        on_complete: Optional callback function called when the agent run completes successfully.
            The callback receives the completed [`AgentRunResult`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult] and can access `all_messages()` and other result data.

        This method builds an internal agent graph (using system prompts, tools and output schemas) and then returns an
        `AgentRun` object. The `AgentRun` can be used to async-iterate over the nodes of the graph as they are
        executed. This is the API to use if you want to consume the outputs coming from each LLM model response, or the
        stream of events coming from the execution of tools.
