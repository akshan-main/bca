        injected into the `state` field of a `deps` object that implements the [`StateHandler`][pydantic_ai.ui.StateHandler] protocol.
        To provide different `deps` for each request (e.g. based on the authenticated user),
        use [`AGUIAdapter.run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.ui.ag_ui.AGUIAdapter.run_stream] or
        [`AGUIAdapter.dispatch_request()`][pydantic_ai.ui.ag_ui.AGUIAdapter.dispatch_request] instead.

        Args:
            agent: The agent to run.

            output_type: Custom output type to use for this run, `output_type` may only be used if the agent has
                no output validators since output validators would expect an argument that matches the agent's
                output type.
            message_history: History of the conversation so far.
            deferred_tool_results: Optional results for deferred tool calls in the message history.
            model: Optional model to use for this run, required if `model` was not set when creating the agent.
            deps: Optional dependencies to use for this run.
            model_settings: Optional settings to use for this model's request.
            usage_limits: Optional limits on model request count or token usage.
            usage: Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools.
            infer_name: Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set.
            toolsets: Optional additional toolsets for this run.
            builtin_tools: Optional additional builtin tools for this run.
            on_complete: Optional callback function called when the agent run completes successfully.
                The callback receives the completed [`AgentRunResult`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult] and can access `all_messages()` and other result data.

            debug: Boolean indicating if debug tracebacks should be returned on errors.
            routes: A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests.
            middleware: A list of middleware to run for every request. A starlette application will always
                automatically include two middleware classes. `ServerErrorMiddleware` is added as the very
                outermost middleware, to handle any uncaught errors occurring anywhere in the entire stack.
                `ExceptionMiddleware` is added as the very innermost middleware, to deal with handled
                exception cases occurring in the routing or endpoints.
            exception_handlers: A mapping of either integer status codes, or exception class types onto
                callables which handle the exceptions. Exception handler callables should be of the form
                `handler(request, exc) -> response` and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            on_startup: A list of callables to run on application startup. Startup handler callables do not
                take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            on_shutdown: A list of callables to run on application shutdown. Shutdown handler callables do
                not take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            lifespan: A lifespan context function, which can be used to perform startup and shutdown tasks.
                This is a newer style that replaces the `on_startup` and `on_shutdown` handlers. Use one or
                the other, not both.

        This is a convenience method that wraps [`run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run_stream] with `loop.run_until_complete(...)`.
        You therefore can't use this method inside async code or if there's an active event loop.

        This method builds an internal agent graph (using system prompts, tools and output schemas) and then
        runs the graph until the model produces output matching the `output_type`, for example text or structured data.
        At this point, a streaming run result object is yielded from which you can stream the output as it comes in,
        and -- once this output has completed streaming -- get the complete output, message history, and usage.

        As this method will consider the first output matching the `output_type` to be the final output,
        it will stop running the agent graph and will not execute any tool calls made by the model after this "final" output.
        If you want to always run the agent graph to completion and stream events and output at the same time,

                output type.
            message_history: History of the conversation so far.
            deferred_tool_results: Optional results for deferred tool calls in the message history.

            deps: Optional dependencies to use for this run.
            model_settings: Optional settings to use for this model's request.
            usage_limits: Optional limits on model request count or token usage.
            usage: Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools.
            infer_name: Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set.
            toolsets: Optional additional toolsets for this run.

            debug: Boolean indicating if debug tracebacks should be returned on errors.
            routes: A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests.
            middleware: A list of middleware to run for every request. A starlette application will always
                automatically include two middleware classes. `ServerErrorMiddleware` is added as the very
                outermost middleware, to handle any uncaught errors occurring anywhere in the entire stack.
                `ExceptionMiddleware` is added as the very innermost middleware, to deal with handled
                exception cases occurring in the routing or endpoints.
            exception_handlers: A mapping of either integer status codes, or exception class types onto
                callables which handle the exceptions. Exception handler callables should be of the form
                `handler(request, exc) -> response` and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            on_startup: A list of callables to run on application startup. Startup handler callables do not
                take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            on_shutdown: A list of callables to run on application shutdown. Shutdown handler callables do
                not take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            lifespan: A lifespan context function, which can be used to perform startup and shutdown tasks.
                This is a newer style that replaces the `on_startup` and `on_shutdown` handlers. Use one or
                the other, not both.
