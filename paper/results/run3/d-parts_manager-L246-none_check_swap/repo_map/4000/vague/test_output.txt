nt, creating or updating a TextPart in the manager as appropriate.
    
        When `vendor_part_id` is None, the latest part is updated if it exists and is a TextPart;
        otherwise, a new TextPart is created. When a non-None ID is specified, the TextPart corresponding
        to that vendor ID is either created or updated.
    
        Args:
            vendor_part_id: The ID the vendor uses to identify this piece
                of text. If None, a new part will be created unless the latest part is already
                a TextPart.
            content: The text content to append to the appropriate TextPart.
            id: An optional id for the text part.
            provider_name: An optional provider name for the text part.
            provider_details: An optional dictionary of provider-specific details for the text part.
            thinking_tags: If provided, will handle content between the thinking tags as thinking parts.
            ignore_leading_whitespace: If True, will ignore leading whitespace in the content.
    
        Yields:
            A `PartStartEvent` if a new part was created, or a `PartDeltaEvent` if an existing part was updated.
            Yields nothing if no event should be emitted (e.g., the first text part was all whitespace).
    
        Raises:
            UnexpectedModelBehavior: If attempting to apply text content to a part that is not a TextPart.

The event loop scope for asynchronous fixtures will default to the fixture caching scope. Future versions of pytest-asyncio will default the loop scope for asynchronous fixtures to function scope. Set the default fixture loop scope explicitly in order to avoid unexpected behavior in the future. Valid fixture loop scopes are: "function", "class", "module", "package", "session"
