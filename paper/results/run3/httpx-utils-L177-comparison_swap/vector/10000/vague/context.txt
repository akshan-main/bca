    `HEAD`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`.
    * **url** - URL for the new `Request` object.
    * **params** - *(optional)* Query parameters to include in the URL, as a
    string, dictionary, or sequence of two-tuples.
    * **content** - *(optional)* Binary content to include in the body of the
    request, as bytes or a byte iterator.
    * **data** - *(optional)* Form data to include in the body of the request,
    as a dictionary.
    * **files** - *(optional)* A dictionary of upload files to include in the
    body of the request.
    * **json** - *(optional)* A JSON serializable object to include in the body
    of the request.
    * **headers** - *(optional)* Dictionary of HTTP headers to include in the
    request.
    * **cookies** - *(optional)* Dictionary of Cookie items to include in the
    request.
    * **auth** - *(optional)* An authentication class to use when sending the
    request.
    * **proxy** - *(optional)* A proxy URL where all the traffic should be routed.
    * **timeout** - *(optional)* The timeout configuration to use when sending
    the request.
    * **follow_redirects** - *(optional)* Enables or disables HTTP redirects.
    * **verify** - *(optional)* Either `True` to use an SSL context with the
    default CA bundle, `False` to disable verification, or an instance of
    `ssl.SSLContext` to use a custom context.
    * **trust_env** - *(optional)* Enables or disables usage of environment
    variables for configuration.

        In order to properly release any network resources, the response
        stream should *either* be consumed immediately, with a call to
        `response.stream.read()`, or else the `handle_request` call should
        be followed with a try/finally block to ensuring the stream is
        always closed.

        Example usage:

            with httpx.HTTPTransport() as transport:
                req = httpx.Request(
                    method=b"GET",
                    url=(b"https", b"www.example.com", 443, b"/"),
                    headers=[(b"Host", b"www.example.com")],
                )
                resp = transport.handle_request(req)
                body = resp.stream.read()
                print(resp.status_code, resp.headers, body)


        Takes a `Request` instance as the only argument.

        Returns a `Response` instance.
