"""Retries utilities based on tenacity, especially for HTTP requests.

This module provides HTTP transport wrappers and wait strategies that integrate with
the tenacity library to add retry capabilities to HTTP requests. The transports can be
used with HTTP clients that support custom transports (such as httpx), while the wait
strategies can be used with any tenacity retry decorator.

The module includes:
- TenacityTransport: Synchronous HTTP transport with retry capabilities
- AsyncTenacityTransport: Asynchronous HTTP transport with retry capabilities
- wait_retry_after: Wait strategy that respects HTTP Retry-After headers

class TenacityTransport(BaseTransport):
    """Synchronous HTTP transport with tenacity-based retry functionality.

    This transport wraps another BaseTransport and adds retry capabilities using the tenacity library.
    It can be configured to retry requests based on various conditions such as specific exception types,
    response status codes, or custom validation logic.

    The transport works by intercepting HTTP requests and responses, allowing the tenacity controller
    to determine when and how to retry failed requests. The validate_response function can be used
    to convert HTTP responses into exceptions that trigger retries.

    Args:
        wrapped: The underlying transport to wrap and add retry functionality to.
        config: The arguments to use for the tenacity `retry` decorator, including retry conditions,
            wait strategy, stop conditions, etc. See the tenacity docs for more info.
        validate_response: Optional callable that takes a Response and can raise an exception
            to be handled by the controller if the response should trigger a retry.
            Common use case is to raise exceptions for certain HTTP status codes.
            If None, no response validation is performed.

    Example:
        ```python
        from httpx import Client, HTTPStatusError, HTTPTransport
        from tenacity import retry_if_exception_type, stop_after_attempt

        from pydantic_ai.retries import RetryConfig, TenacityTransport, wait_retry_after
