    For some parameters such as `auth=...` and `timeout=...` we need to be able

    The default "unset" state indicates that whatever default is set on the

    explicitly disables the parameter, possibly overriding a client default.

    For example we use `timeout=USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT` in the `request()` signature.
    Omitting the `timeout` parameter will send a request using whatever default
    timeout has been configured on the client. Including `timeout=None` will
    ensure no timeout is used.

    Note that user code shouldn't need to use the `USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT` constant,
