class Auth:
    """
    Base class for all authentication schemes.

    To implement a custom authentication scheme, subclass `Auth` and override
    the `.auth_flow()` method.

    If the authentication scheme does I/O such as disk access or network calls, or uses
    synchronization primitives such as locks, you should override `.sync_auth_flow()`
    and/or `.async_auth_flow()` instead of `.auth_flow()` to provide specialized
    implementations that will be used by `Client` and `AsyncClient` respectively.

        To dispatch a request, `yield` it:

        ```

        The client will `.send()` the response back into the flow generator. You can
        access it like so:

        ```
        response = yield request
        ```

        A `return` (or reaching the end of the generator) will result in the
        client returning the last response obtained from the server.

        You can dispatch as many requests as is necessary.

        Send a single HTTP request and return a response.

        Developers shouldn't typically ever need to call into this API directly,
        since the Client class provides all the higher level user-facing API
        niceties.

        In order to properly release any network resources, the response
        stream should *either* be consumed immediately, with a call to
        `response.stream.read()`, or else the `handle_request` call should
        be followed with a try/finally block to ensuring the stream is
        always closed.
