            description: The description of the tool, defaults to the function docstring.
            retries: The number of retries to allow for this tool, defaults to the agent's default retries,
                which defaults to 1.
            prepare: custom method to prepare the tool definition for each step, return `None` to omit this
                tool from a given step. This is useful if you want to customise a tool at call time,
                or omit it completely from a step. See [`ToolPrepareFunc`][pydantic_ai.tools.ToolPrepareFunc].
            docstring_format: The format of the docstring, see [`DocstringFormat`][pydantic_ai.tools.DocstringFormat].
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.
            require_parameter_descriptions: If True, raise an error if a parameter description is missing.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.
            schema_generator: The JSON schema generator class to use for this tool.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.

                See [`ToolDefinition`][pydantic_ai.tools.ToolDefinition] for more info.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.
            sequential: Whether the function requires a sequential/serial execution environment. Defaults to False.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.
            requires_approval: Whether this tool requires human-in-the-loop approval. Defaults to False.
                See the [tools documentation](../deferred-tools.md#human-in-the-loop-tool-approval) for more info.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.
            metadata: Optional metadata for the tool. This is not sent to the model but can be used for filtering and tool behavior customization.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset. If provided, it will be merged with the toolset's metadata.
            timeout: Timeout in seconds for tool execution. If the tool takes longer, a retry prompt is returned to the model.

        This method builds an internal agent graph (using system prompts, tools and output schemas) and then
        runs the graph until the model produces output matching the `output_type`, for example text or structured data.
        At this point, a streaming run result object is yielded from which you can stream the output as it comes in,
        and -- once this output has completed streaming -- get the complete output, message history, and usage.

        As this method will consider the first output matching the `output_type` to be the final output,
        it will stop running the agent graph and will not execute any tool calls made by the model after this "final" output.
        If you want to always run the agent graph to completion and stream events and output at the same time,
        use [`agent.run()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run] with an `event_stream_handler` or [`agent.iter()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.iter] instead.

        Example:
        ```python

                output validators since output validators would expect an argument that matches the agent's output type.
            message_history: History of the conversation so far.
            deferred_tool_results: Optional results for deferred tool calls in the message history.

            usage_limits: Optional limits on model request count or token usage.
            usage: Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools.
            metadata: Optional metadata to attach to this run. Accepts a dictionary or a callable taking
                [`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext]; merged with the agent's configured metadata.
            infer_name: Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set.

        """Run the agent with a user prompt in sync streaming mode.

        This is a convenience method that wraps [`run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run_stream] with `loop.run_until_complete(...)`.
        You therefore can't use this method inside async code or if there's an active event loop.

        This method builds an internal agent graph (using system prompts, tools and output schemas) and then
        runs the graph until the model produces output matching the `output_type`, for example text or structured data.
        At this point, a streaming run result object is yielded from which you can stream the output as it comes in,
        and -- once this output has completed streaming -- get the complete output, message history, and usage.

        As this method will consider the first output matching the `output_type` to be the final output,
        it will stop running the agent graph and will not execute any tool calls made by the model after this "final" output.
        If you want to always run the agent graph to completion and stream events and output at the same time,
        use [`agent.run()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run] with an `event_stream_handler` or [`agent.iter()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.iter] instead.

        Example:
        ```python
        from pydantic_ai import Agent

        agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

        def main():
            response = agent.run_stream_sync('What is the capital of the UK?')

        Args:
            tools: The tools to add to the toolset.
            max_retries: The maximum number of retries for each tool during a run.
                Applies to all tools, unless overridden when adding a tool.
            timeout: Timeout in seconds for tool execution. If a tool takes longer than this,
                a retry prompt is returned to the model. Individual tools can override this with their own timeout.
                Defaults to None (no timeout).
            docstring_format: Format of tool docstring, see [`DocstringFormat`][pydantic_ai.tools.DocstringFormat].
                Defaults to `'auto'`, such that the format is inferred from the structure of the docstring.
                Applies to all tools, unless overridden when adding a tool.
            require_parameter_descriptions: If True, raise an error if a parameter description is missing. Defaults to False.
                Applies to all tools, unless overridden when adding a tool.
            schema_generator: The JSON schema generator class to use for this tool. Defaults to `GenerateToolJsonSchema`.
                Applies to all tools, unless overridden when adding a tool.
            strict: Whether to enforce JSON schema compliance (only affects OpenAI).
                See [`ToolDefinition`][pydantic_ai.tools.ToolDefinition] for more info.
            sequential: Whether the function requires a sequential/serial execution environment. Defaults to False.
                Applies to all tools, unless overridden when adding a tool.
            requires_approval: Whether this tool requires human-in-the-loop approval. Defaults to False.
                See the [tools documentation](../deferred-tools.md#human-in-the-loop-tool-approval) for more info.
                Applies to all tools, unless overridden when adding a tool.
            metadata: Optional metadata for the tool. This is not sent to the model but can be used for filtering and tool behavior customization.
                Applies to all tools, unless overridden when adding a tool, which will be merged with the toolset's metadata.
            id: An optional unique ID for the toolset. A toolset needs to have an ID in order to be used in a durable execution environment like Temporal,
                in which case the ID will be used to identify the toolset's activities within the workflow.
