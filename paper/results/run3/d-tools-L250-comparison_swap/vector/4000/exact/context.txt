            description: The description of the tool, defaults to the function docstring.
            retries: The number of retries to allow for this tool, defaults to the agent's default retries,
                which defaults to 1.
            prepare: custom method to prepare the tool definition for each step, return `None` to omit this
                tool from a given step. This is useful if you want to customise a tool at call time,
                or omit it completely from a step. See [`ToolPrepareFunc`][pydantic_ai.tools.ToolPrepareFunc].
            docstring_format: The format of the docstring, see [`DocstringFormat`][pydantic_ai.tools.DocstringFormat].
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.
            require_parameter_descriptions: If True, raise an error if a parameter description is missing.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.
            schema_generator: The JSON schema generator class to use for this tool.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.

                See [`ToolDefinition`][pydantic_ai.tools.ToolDefinition] for more info.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.
            sequential: Whether the function requires a sequential/serial execution environment. Defaults to False.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.
            requires_approval: Whether this tool requires human-in-the-loop approval. Defaults to False.
                See the [tools documentation](../deferred-tools.md#human-in-the-loop-tool-approval) for more info.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset.
            metadata: Optional metadata for the tool. This is not sent to the model but can be used for filtering and tool behavior customization.
                If `None`, the default value is determined by the toolset. If provided, it will be merged with the toolset's metadata.
            timeout: Timeout in seconds for tool execution. If the tool takes longer, a retry prompt is returned to the model.

        This method builds an internal agent graph (using system prompts, tools and output schemas) and then
        runs the graph until the model produces output matching the `output_type`, for example text or structured data.
        At this point, a streaming run result object is yielded from which you can stream the output as it comes in,
        and -- once this output has completed streaming -- get the complete output, message history, and usage.

        As this method will consider the first output matching the `output_type` to be the final output,
        it will stop running the agent graph and will not execute any tool calls made by the model after this "final" output.
        If you want to always run the agent graph to completion and stream events and output at the same time,
        use [`agent.run()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run] with an `event_stream_handler` or [`agent.iter()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.iter] instead.

        Example:
        ```python

                output validators since output validators would expect an argument that matches the agent's output type.
            message_history: History of the conversation so far.
            deferred_tool_results: Optional results for deferred tool calls in the message history.

            usage_limits: Optional limits on model request count or token usage.
            usage: Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools.
            metadata: Optional metadata to attach to this run. Accepts a dictionary or a callable taking
                [`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext]; merged with the agent's configured metadata.
            infer_name: Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set.

        """Run the agent with a user prompt in sync streaming mode.

        This is a convenience method that wraps [`run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run_stream] with `loop.run_until_complete(...)`.
        You therefore can't use this method inside async code or if there's an active event loop.

        This method builds an internal agent graph (using system prompts, tools and output schemas) and then
        runs the graph until the model produces output matching the `output_type`, for example text or structured data.
        At this point, a streaming run result object is yielded from which you can stream the output as it comes in,
        and -- once this output has completed streaming -- get the complete output, message history, and usage.

        As this method will consider the first output matching the `output_type` to be the final output,
        it will stop running the agent graph and will not execute any tool calls made by the model after this "final" output.
        If you want to always run the agent graph to completion and stream events and output at the same time,
        use [`agent.run()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run] with an `event_stream_handler` or [`agent.iter()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.iter] instead.

        Example:
        ```python
        from pydantic_ai import Agent

        agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

        def main():
            response = agent.run_stream_sync('What is the capital of the UK?')
            print(response.get_output())
            #> The capital of the UK is London.
        ```

        Args:
            user_prompt: User input to start/continue the conversation.
            output_type: Custom output type to use for this run, `output_type` may only be used if the agent has no
                output validators since output validators would expect an argument that matches the agent's output type.
            message_history: History of the conversation so far.
            deferred_tool_results: Optional results for deferred tool calls in the message history.
            model: Optional model to use for this run, required if `model` was not set when creating the agent.
            deps: Optional dependencies to use for this run.
            model_settings: Optional settings to use for this model's request.
            usage_limits: Optional limits on model request count or token usage.
            usage: Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools.
            metadata: Optional metadata to attach to this run. Accepts a dictionary or a callable taking
                [`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext]; merged with the agent's configured metadata.
            infer_name: Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set.
            toolsets: Optional additional toolsets for this run.
            builtin_tools: Optional additional builtin tools for this run.
            event_stream_handler: Optional handler for events from the model's streaming response and the agent's execution of tools to use for this run.
                It will receive all the events up until the final result is found, which you can then read or stream from inside the context manager.
                Note that it does _not_ receive any events after the final result is found.

        Returns:
            The result of the run.
