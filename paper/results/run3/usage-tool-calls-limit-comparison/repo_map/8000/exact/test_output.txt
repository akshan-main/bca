history_processors: Optional list of callables to process the message history before sending it to the model.
                Each processor takes a list of messages and returns a modified list of messages.
                Processors can be sync or async and are applied in sequence.
            event_stream_handler: Optional handler for events from the model's streaming response and the agent's execution of tools.
            tool_timeout: Default timeout in seconds for tool execution. If a tool takes longer than this,
                the tool is considered to have failed and a retry prompt is returned to the model (counting towards the retry limit).
                Individual tools can override this with their own timeout. Defaults to None (no timeout).
            max_concurrency: Optional limit on concurrent agent runs. Can be an integer for simple limiting,
                a [`ConcurrencyLimit`][pydantic_ai.ConcurrencyLimit] for advanced configuration with backpressure,
                a [`ConcurrencyLimiter`][pydantic_ai.ConcurrencyLimiter] for sharing limits across
                multiple agents, or None (default) for no limiting. When the limit is reached, additional calls
                to `run()` or `iter()` will wait until a slot becomes available.

/Users/akshankrithick/anaconda3/envs/vvenv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pytest_asyncio/plugin.py:247: PytestDeprecationWarning: The configuration option "asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope" is unset.
The event loop scope for asynchronous fixtures will default to the fixture caching scope. Future versions of pytest-asyncio will default the loop scope for asynchronous fixtures to function scope. Set the default fixture loop scope explicitly in order to avoid unexpected behavior in the future. Valid fixture loop scopes are: "function", "class", "module", "package", "session"
