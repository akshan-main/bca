    Effectively, this debounces the iterator.

    This returns a context manager usable as an iterator so any pending tasks can be cancelled if an error occurs

    Usage:

    ```python
    async with group_by_temporal(yield_groups(), 0.1) as groups_iter:
        async for groups in groups_iter:
            print(groups)
    ```

        soft_max_interval: Maximum interval over which to group items, this should avoid a trickle of items causing
            a group to never be yielded. It's a soft max in the sense that once we're over this time, we yield items
            as soon as `anext(aiter)` returns. If `None`, no grouping/debouncing is performed

    Returns:
        A context manager usable as an async iterable of lists of items produced by the input async iterable.
