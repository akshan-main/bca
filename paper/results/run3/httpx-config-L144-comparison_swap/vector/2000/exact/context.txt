        Send a single HTTP request and return a response.

        Developers shouldn't typically ever need to call into this API directly,
        since the Client class provides all the higher level user-facing API
        niceties.

        stream should *either* be consumed immediately, with a call to
        `response.stream.read()`, or else the `handle_request` call should
        be followed with a try/finally block to ensuring the stream is
        always closed.
