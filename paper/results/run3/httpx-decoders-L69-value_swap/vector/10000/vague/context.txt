class WSGITransport(BaseTransport):
    """
    A custom transport that handles sending requests directly to an WSGI app.
    The simplest way to use this functionality is to use the `app` argument.

    ```
    client = httpx.Client(app=app)
    ```

    Alternatively, you can setup the transport instance explicitly.
    This allows you to include any additional configuration arguments specific
    to the WSGITransport class:

    ```
    transport = httpx.WSGITransport(
        app=app,
        script_name="/submount",
        remote_addr="1.2.3.4"
    )
    client = httpx.Client(transport=transport)
    ```

    Arguments:

    * `app` - The WSGI application.
    * `raise_app_exceptions` - Boolean indicating if exceptions in the application
       should be raised. Default to `True`. Can be set to `False` for use cases
       such as testing the content of a client 500 response.
    * `script_name` - The root path on which the WSGI application should be mounted.
    * `remote_addr` - A string indicating the client IP of incoming requests.
