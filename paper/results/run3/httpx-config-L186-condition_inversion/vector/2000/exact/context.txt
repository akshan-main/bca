    * **url** - URL for the new `Request` object.
    * **params** - *(optional)* Query parameters to include in the URL, as a
    string, dictionary, or sequence of two-tuples.
    * **content** - *(optional)* Binary content to include in the body of the
    request, as bytes or a byte iterator.
    * **data** - *(optional)* Form data to include in the body of the request,
    as a dictionary.
    * **files** - *(optional)* A dictionary of upload files to include in the
    body of the request.
    * **json** - *(optional)* A JSON serializable object to include in the body
    of the request.
    * **headers** - *(optional)* Dictionary of HTTP headers to include in the
    request.
    * **cookies** - *(optional)* Dictionary of Cookie items to include in the

    * **auth** - *(optional)* An authentication class to use when sending the
    request.
    * **proxy** - *(optional)* A proxy URL where all the traffic should be routed.
    * **timeout** - *(optional)* The timeout configuration to use when sending
    the request.
    * **follow_redirects** - *(optional)* Enables or disables HTTP redirects.
    * **verify** - *(optional)* Either `True` to use an SSL context with the

    For example we use `timeout=USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT` in the `request()` signature.
