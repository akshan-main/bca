    Sends an HTTP request.

    **Parameters:**

    * **method** - HTTP method for the new `Request` object: `GET`, `OPTIONS`,
    `HEAD`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`.
    * **url** - URL for the new `Request` object.
    * **params** - *(optional)* Query parameters to include in the URL, as a
    string, dictionary, or sequence of two-tuples.
    * **content** - *(optional)* Binary content to include in the body of the
    request, as bytes or a byte iterator.
    * **data** - *(optional)* Form data to include in the body of the request,
    as a dictionary.
    * **files** - *(optional)* A dictionary of upload files to include in the
    body of the request.
    * **json** - *(optional)* A JSON serializable object to include in the body
    of the request.
    * **headers** - *(optional)* Dictionary of HTTP headers to include in the
    request.
    * **cookies** - *(optional)* Dictionary of Cookie items to include in the
    request.
    * **auth** - *(optional)* An authentication class to use when sending the
    request.
    * **proxy** - *(optional)* A proxy URL where all the traffic should be routed.
    * **timeout** - *(optional)* The timeout configuration to use when sending
    the request.
    * **follow_redirects** - *(optional)* Enables or disables HTTP redirects.
    * **verify** - *(optional)* Either `True` to use an SSL context with the
    default CA bundle, `False` to disable verification, or an instance of
    `ssl.SSLContext` to use a custom context.
    * **trust_env** - *(optional)* Enables or disables usage of environment
    variables for configuration.

    **Returns:** `Response`

    Usage:

    ```
    >>> import httpx
    >>> response = httpx.request('GET', 'https://httpbin.org/get')
    >>> response
    <Response [200 OK]>

    For some parameters such as `auth=...` and `timeout=...` we need to be able

    The default "unset" state indicates that whatever default is set on the

    explicitly disables the parameter, possibly overriding a client default.

    For example we use `timeout=USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT` in the `request()` signature.
    Omitting the `timeout` parameter will send a request using whatever default
    timeout has been configured on the client. Including `timeout=None` will
    ensure no timeout is used.

    Note that user code shouldn't need to use the `USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT` constant,
    but it is used internally when a parameter is not included.
