Feature Validity Audit
  (Which features can each router legitimately use in a real deployment?)
==========================================================================================

  Router A (pre-retrieval, choose-first):
    VALID:
      entity_count_extracted      — parsed from query text
      entity_count_mapped         — looked up in graph (cheap, local)
      query_identifier_density    — computed from query text
      graph_node_count            — repo-level constant (known at init)
      budget                      — given by user/system

    INVALID (not available before retrieval):
      retrieval_*                 — requires running a retrieval method
      tokens_used, symbols_selected, files_included — assembly output
      assembly_time_ms            — assembly output
      bca_*                       — BCA-specific assembly output

    INVALID (leakage — requires knowing mutation location):
      mutation_symbol_lines       — size of mutated function
      mutation_file_symbols       — symbols in mutated file
      target_file_hit             — requires knowing target file
      target_symbol_hit           — requires knowing target symbol
      min_hops_seed_to_mutation   — requires knowing mutation
      median_hops_seed_to_mutation
      edit_distance_lines         — post-hoc evaluation metric

  Router B (dry-run retrieval, then choose):
    VALID (all Router A features PLUS per-method):
      retrieval_top1_score        — confidence of top retrieval result
      retrieval_budget_utilization — fraction of budget used
      retrieval_softmax_entropy   — score distribution spread
      retrieval_effective_candidates — number of competitive candidates
      retrieval_top1_top2_gap     — gap between #1 and #2 scores
      tokens_used                 — context size produced
      symbols_selected            — number of symbols selected
      files_included              — number of files in context
      bca_frontier_visited        — BCA traversal breadth
      bca_closure_added_*         — BCA closure overhead

      NOTE: These are per-method. Router B has one value per candidate method.

    STILL INVALID (leakage):
      target_file_hit, target_symbol_hit, mutation_*, min_hops_*,
      edit_distance_*, tests_passed, failure_mode, patch, test_output



==========================================================================================
Router A: Choose-First (Pre-Retrieval Features Only)
  Decision based on query + repo features BEFORE running any retrieval.
  Features: entity_count_mapped, query_identifier_density, graph_node_count_log
  Candidates: bca, bca_d1, bca_d5, bca_no_closure, bca_no_scoring, bm25, no_retrieval, keyword_map, vector
  Evaluation: LOO-CV, success = predicted method is in passing set
  Two strategies: 'smart' (default→deviate) and 'safest' (always safest)

Router B: Dry-Run Then Choose (Retrieval Confidence Features)
  Runs all retrieval methods locally (no LLM call), examines their
  confidence metrics, picks the best method, then calls LLM once.
  Features: Router A + per-method {top1_score, budget_util, entropy}
  Total features: 27 (3 query + 8 methods x 3 metrics)
  Candidates: bca, bca_d1, bca_d5, bca_no_closure, bca_no_scoring, bm25, keyword_map, vector
