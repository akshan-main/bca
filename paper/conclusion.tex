\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We formalized budgeted context assembly as constrained submodular maximization
over a code knowledge graph and presented a greedy algorithm with dependency
closure constraints.  The algorithm guarantees budget adherence and dependency
completeness---properties that ad-hoc retrieval methods lack.

Our evaluation on 12 coding tasks confirms that dependency closure is the
critical component: without it, budget violations occur on nearly every task.
Lexical retrieval (BM25) achieves higher keyword recall, suggesting that a
hybrid approach---lexical candidate generation followed by graph-based
dependency-aware packing---is a promising direction.

The implementation is available as \textsc{CeGraph}, a pip-installable tool
supporting Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript via tree-sitter.
